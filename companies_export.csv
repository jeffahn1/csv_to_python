Our principals, with in excess of 70 years of commercial real estate experience, add value by fast understanding of the real value and exit strategies appropriate for the specific real estate assets under consideration. Atlas will undertake selected third-party advisory and consulting assignments. In these cases, the challenges take many forms but typically require a property or portfolio evaluation to determine not only market value, but also value within the client's overall operating structure.Assignments usually involve making specific recommendations regarding real estate holdings and, in most cases, executing a plan of action that maximizes the return to the client and/or user. We have reviewed in excess of 135 appraisals for our lender clients. Our main focus is the acquisition of stressed and distressed Commercial and Industrial loans from banks and non-bank lenders. We prefer particularly ""messy"" cases and frequently deal with unpaid wages to both union and non-union employees. Our principals' commercial finance experience permits us to unravel situations that are especially complex. ur preference is to purchase loans with a real value of $1 million to $7 million. ecause we are deploying principal funds, we have a very flat and short decision process and have closed multiple purchases in as little as ten days. We also have an affiliate which makes investments in early stage and start-up businesses.

"16402913928","Winchestersavings","The Winchester Savings Bank was established by the Massachusetts Legislature and incorporated on March 3, 1871. The first meeting of the Corporators was held in Lyceum Hall (the building at the corner of Main and Mt. Vernon Streets in Winchester) on July 11, 1871. The Bank first opened its doors for business on August 26, 1871, in a banking room on the north side of Main Street. In 1880, the Bank moved to the second floor of the Brown and Stanton Block on Main Street, and remained there until 1892 when it moved into its newly constructed building at 26 Mt. Vernon Street. This building still stands today and is regarded as a historical building by the Winchester Historical Society. The Bank's main office was moved on December 10, 1979 to its present location at 661 Main Street. Since its founding in 1871, the Bank has grown into a full-service financial institution. The Bank is an independent, mutual, state-chartered institution with a mission of meeting the financial needs of the communities which it serves. The Bank is directed by a Board of Trustees elected by the Bank's Corporators, a group of civic-minded, local individuals. Since the Bank is mutual, all profits from operations are reinvested in the Bank. In 2012, Winchester Savings introduced a new logo that represents the three core values the Bank strives to embrace every day...

Quincy Municipal City Workers and their family members still comprise a significant number of QCU's over 31,000 Members. This large percentage is due in part by the loyalty of Members who refer their family and friends for their first mortgage, auto loan, or savings plan. Much has changed over the course of 80 years, but much has also stayed the same. The name, location and operating charter of QCU changed, but its belief in people helping people is still the cornerstone of the Credit Union's service philosophy. QCU built its business on a strong commitment to the community and its Members. It is what differentiates Quincy Credit Union in the marketplace today. Quincy Credit Union has continually given back to its community in many different ways; like the Quincy School Community and Partnership. More recently, the credit union has also been active in supporting the communities of Braintree and Weymouth through many community initiatives. The success of Quincy Credit Union is attributed in part by three driving factors: the strong volunteer board of directors and dedicated staff; the ability to provide excellent service to loyal Members at every visit, and the willingness, and ability to quickly adapt to industry trends. QCU prides itself on its many no fee services, competitive interest rates on a wide variety of loans, and state of the art technology and security.","Contact Established","SELLER","https://www.linkedin.com/company/quincy-credit-union","qcu.org","Banking"

We refuse to let a few bad apples"" make life more difficult for everyone else. 99.99% of the people we work with are honest and trustworthy. In fact, it's amazing how rarely we run up against someone who isn't. And so, at Fidelity Bank, our policies are designed to make banking here easier for good people - the vast majority.

Our Board and Management largely view themselves as stewards of a community resource and to manage and improve the bank in preparation for a transfer to future generations.\r\n \r\nWe compete daily with all forms of financial institutions.

In 1993, the Bank saw an opportunity to develop a community banking office in Summerville by staffing it with local people. In 1994, the Bank recognized a need to establish a Mortgage Origination Department to better serve its customers' needs. In May of 1996, another opportunity presented itself and The Bank of South Carolina opened a Mt. Pleasant banking office, again staffing it with local people. A fourth office was opened in March of 1998 to serve the needs of the West Ashley community.

In 2011, the Thomson family sold the Bank to Mert Lund, who had owned community banks over the last 40 years. With innovative ideas, the Bank was renamed ONE AMERICAN BANK with two locations in Sioux Falls and one in Centerville. Sadly, in January of 2013, Mert passed away leaving his banking legacy to his wife Karen and son George. The Lunds have reaffirmed their commitment to maintain and grow the Bank per Mert's wishes. The Bank has a solid management team in place and a commitment to maintain customer service excellence.
